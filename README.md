# Forked Repository Practice

## Description
This repository was forked as a part of college assignment to practice git and github workflows.
The tasks performed include forking the repository, cloning it to the local system, adding a new file with content and creating a '.gitignore' file to manage the 
untracked files effectively.

       git clone <url-of-the-repository>

3. **Made changes locally**:
   - created a file using the following command : touch <file-name>.
   - added some content in it using the command : echo "<the content>" > "file-name".
   - staged the changes to be commited using the command : git add .
   - commited the changes : git commit - m"commit message"
   - And at the end pushed the changes to the remote repository using command : git push origin master

4. **Created a Pull Request** :
   - Navigated to my forked repository on github.
   - Opened the "Pull Requests" tab and clicked "New Pull Request".
   - Compared my forked repository with original repository.
